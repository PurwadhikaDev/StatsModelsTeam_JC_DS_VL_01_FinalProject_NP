### Business Problem

*Water quality changes because it is affected by many factors including weather, climate, rainfall, industrial and sewage discharges,example,when water gets a lot of heat intensity from sunlight, the pH will rise and the water is alkaline.But when temperatures are cold, the pH of the water will drop and the water will be acidic.Every month, our company must prepare a team to check the quality of the water before it is produced and marketed to consumers. Therefore, the company wants to find a more efficient way to solve this problem.Therefore, data scientists conducted water quality modeling and prediction for water pollution control with machine learning.*
